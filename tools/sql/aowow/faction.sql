Before the Dark Iron Clan was banished from the city, eventually leading to the War of the Three Hammers, Ironforge was the commercial and social center of all the dwarven clans. It is now home to the Bronzebeard Clan. Many dwarven strongholds fell during the Second War between the Horde and the Alliance of Lordaeron, but the mighty city of Ironforge, nestled in the wintry peaks of <a href="?zone=1">Dun Morogh</a> and protected by its great gates, was never breached by the invading Horde. <br /><br />Relatively recently, Ironforge also became home to the Gnomeregan refugees. After the Third War, the gnomish city of Gnomeregan became overrun by troggs. Since, a number of gnomes have settled in Ironforge, converting an area of that city to their liking, an area now known as Tinker Town. <br /><br />Ironforge is one of most populated cities in the world, coming after the human city of <a href="?zone=1519">Stormwind</a>, and housing 20,000 people. A marvel to the dwarves\' skill at shaping rock and stone, Ironforge was constructed in the very heart of the mountains, an expansive underground city home to explorers, miners, and warriors. Massive doors of rock protect the city in times of war, and lava from the mountain itself is redirected and distributed for heat, energy and smithing purposes. <br /><br />While the Alliance has been weakened by recent events, the dwarves of Ironforge, led by King Magni Bronzebeard, are forging a new future in the world.<h3>Reputation</h3><a href="?npc=14723">Mistina Steelshield</a> has the repeatable cloth reputation quests.

Their membership numbers around 3,000 persons.<br /><br />They have three leaders: <a href="?npc=2423">Lord Aliden Perenolde</a> (who took over from his father Aiden Perenolde), descendent of the original Lord of Alterac, who directs the Syndicate\'s actions in the Alterac Mountains from Strahnbrad; <a href="?npc=2597">Lord Falconcrest</a> directs Syndicate actions in Arathi Highlands from the main keep in the semi-abandoned fortress of Stromgarde; and Lady Beve Perenolde, daughter of Aiden Perenolde.<h3>History</h3>During the Second War the Kingdom of Alterac, led by Lord Perenolde, was discovered to be in league with the Orcish Horde. Perenolde believed that a Horde victory was inevitable, and thus offered aid to the Horde by stirring up rebellions, attacking Alliance bases, and giving them supplies. When this treachery was discovered, the Alliance marched on Alterac and destroyed it. Perenolde and any nobles who went along with his plans were stripped of their titles and land. Many of the nobility managed to escape, however, and began plotting their revenge. Using their still sizable fortunes, the nobility hired a band of thieves and assassins, forming an organization known as the Syndicate.<br /><br />At first the Syndicate\'s goal was just to spread chaos and disorder, striking from hidden bases in the Alterac Mountains. With the end of the Third War and the resultant chaos however, the leaders of the Syndicate saw their chance to return Alterac to its former power. They have now gained control of several outposts in the surrounding area including the sacked fortress of Durnholde Keep and a portion of the city of Stromgarde.<br /><br />They are enemies of both the Alliance, whom they consider their mortal enemies, and the Horde, whom they consider mere brutes good for nothing but slave labor. As a result, the Syndicate is now hunted by both factions, with the <a href="?npc=10181">Banshee Queen Sylvanas Windrunner</a>, in particular, placing a bounty on their heads - guaranteeing that all captured Syndicate members will be summarily executed. In addition, <a href="?npc=4949">Horde Warchief Thrall</a> ordered a number of his agents, including <a href="?npc=2229">Krusk</a>, <a href="?npc=2239">Drull</a>, <a href="?npc=2238">Tog\'Thar</a> and their leader <a href="?npc=2316">Gol\'Dir</a> to launch an investigation into the nature of the Syndicate and its activities, as well as to recover <a href="?item=3498" class="q1">[Taretha\'s Necklace]</a>, which belonged to a dear friend of his, <a href="?npc=18887">Taretha Foxton</a> - a necklace now worn by Elysa, the mistress of Lord Aliden.<h3>Reputation</h3>The Syndicate as a faction in World of Warcraft is very odd in comparison to most factions in that the killing of the factions members will not lower your standing with the faction. For most players who are not a rogue, the only way for the Syndicate to appear on their Reputation Menu is to complete the quest <a href="?quest=8249">Junkboxes Needed</a>, which is available to non-rogues. However, the quest requires <a href="?item=16885" class="q1">[Heavy Junkbox]</a> ... which only rogues can obtain by pick-pocketing NPCs above level fifty, and those can only be traded to you - making it difficult to arrange such a transaction.<br /><br />Currently there is only one known option to increase a player’s reputation with the Syndicate, and that is by killing members of the <a href="?faction=349">Ravenholdt Manor</a> faction. Unfortunately, at the moment little is known about the rewards of increasing Syndicate reputation as all Ravenholdt-affiliated NPCs only give 1 Syndicate Reputation Point, with the exception of <a href="?npc=13085">Myrokos Silentform</a>, who gives 5 (although the corresponding loss of reputation with Ravenholdt is also five times as great). With all players starting at 32000/36000 hated with the faction, it would require killing 10,000 Ravenholdt NPCs to reach Neutral status with the faction; unfortunately, neutral status is the highest you can reach with the Syndicate, and if not to deter players further, none of the Ravenholdt NPCs drop loot.<br /><br /><b>WARNING</b>: If you do decide to kill Ravenholdt NPCs, know that there is currently no way to restore your standings with Ravenholdt, if you do go below Neutral. The reason for the problem is that none of the quests that give Ravenholdt Reputation points will be available because none of the members from Ravenholdt will speak to you. This would mean its a permanent change and you will never be able to interact with any of the NPC loyal to Ravenholdt ever again. Also note that players start at 0/3000 reputation with Ravenholdt, and killing even one of their NPCs at this reputation level will forever prevent you from raising your reputation with them again.'

After the orcs were defeated at the Dark Portal at the end of the Second War, it was decided that the city would be rebuilt, even surpassing its former grandeur. The nobles of Stormwind assembled a team of the most skilled and ingenious stonemasons and architects they could find. Under their direction, Stormwind was rebuilt in an amazingly short period of time. Now, at the end of the Third War, in the renamed Kingdom of Stormwind, it stands as one of the last bastions of human power left in the world. <br /><br />With the fall of the northern kingdoms, Stormwind is by far the most populated city in the world. Boasting a population of two-hundred thousand people (predominantly human), it serves in many ways as the cultural and trade center of the Alliance, even with remote access to the sea. The humans living in the city are generally carefree and artistic, favoring light and colorful clothes, cuisine and art. <br /><br />However, the people of Stormwind find it difficult to accept Theramore\'s role as the home of the new Alliance, convinced not only that Stormwind should be the legitimate heir of Lordaeron\'s role in the past, but also that Theramore is doing little against the worsening situation within the Eastern Kingdoms.<h3>Reputation</h3><a href="?npc=14722">Clavicus Knavingham</a> has the repeatable cloth quests to achieve a higher reputation with Stormwind.

At first it may seem a simple task as the guards don\'t appear as threatening as the other monsters a player faces within the game. However, the guards are highly equipped to neutralize players of any class, to prevent people from attacking each other while in the town. What gives the Booty Bay Bruiser the advantage is several factors, one of them being their ability to use nets to lock you in place, preventing you from escaping. Another is the fact that they spawn every time you attack a citizen of the city or if you’re under Unfriendly status with Booty Bay the Bruisers can spawn if you enter a building, because of this players can soon find them selves swarmed by Bruisers.<br /><br />Yet, theses are just the minor problems, in comparison to the Bruiser’s strongest ability, once it pulls out its gun its unlikely you will live, if you do not escape fast enough. Each time a guard shoots you, the attack throws you back, much like an Ogre hammer attack; the difference here is that the Bruiser can shoot in quick succession causing chain throw backs. A player can literally be thrown from one side of the town to the other, preventing you from attacking. More often you will find your self being forced into a corner, unable to move and unable to attack with each spell being interrupted by the Bruiser’s attack. Because the Bruisers do not put their guns away once they are out, the best course of action is to run away. <br /><br />Through trial and error most people have discovered a safe place to kill Booty Bay Bruisers. If you follow the tunnel leading into the town, the path to your left that leads to the Blacksmith house is the ideal place to kill the guards. Only two guards patrol this path and normally don’t pass each other that closely, allowing both to be dispatched separately. Once they are gone, one can simply enter the first build on the path to cause a guard to spawn if they are below Unfriendly, if not they can simply attack one of the two NPC in the build, both of which are not high in level. Doing this a player should be able to kill 2 to 4 Bruisers before the two patrolling Bruisers re-spawn. On average a player doing this can kill about 30 to 40 Booty Bay Bruisers gaining about 800 reputation points with the pirates. The Bruisers here don’t appear to pull out their guns, but if you find your self in a bad situation, you can jump over the railing running along the path to the waters below, to escape.'

'<b>Zandalar Tribe</b> trolls have come to Yojamba Isle in <a href="?zone=33">Stranglethorn Vale</a> in the effort to recruit help against the resurrected Blood God and his Atal\'ai Priests in <a href="?zone=19">Zul\'Gurub</a> and in the <a href="?zone=1417">Sunken Temple</a>.<h3>History</h3>The Zandalarians were the earliest known trolls, the first tribe from which all tribes originated. Over time two distinct troll empires emerged- the Amani and the Gurubashi. They existed for thousands of years until the coming of the Night Elves, who warred with them and eventually drove both empires into exile. <br /><br />Following the Great Sundering, the defeated Gurubashi grew ever more desperate to eke out a living. Searching for a means to survive, they enlisted the aid of the savage <a href="?npc=14834">Blood God Hakkar</a>, also known as the Soulflayer. Hakkar grew into a merciless oppressor who demanded daily sacrifices from his devotees, and so in time the Gurubashi turned on their dark master. The strongest tribes (including the Zandalar) banded together to defeat Hakkar and his loyal troll priests, the Atal\'ai. The united tribes narrowly defeated the Blood God and cast out the Atal\'ai... despite their victory, however, the Gurubashi Empire soon fell. <br /><br />In recent years the exiled Atal\'ai priests have discovered that Hakkar\'s physical form can only be summoned within the ancient and once-deserted capital of the Gurubashi Empire, Zul\'Gurub. Unfortunately, the priests have met with success in their quest to call forth Hakkar— reports confirm the presence of the dreaded Soulflayer in the heart of the ruins. <br /><br />And so the Zandalar tribe has arrived on the shores of Azeroth to battle Hakkar once again. But the Blood God has grown increasingly powerful, bending several tribes to his will and even commanding the avatars of the Primal Gods— Bat, Panther, Tiger, Spider and Snake. With the tribes splintered, the Zandalarians have been forced to recruit champions from Azeroth\'s varied and disparate races to battle, and hopefully once again defeat, the Soulflayer.<h3>Reputation</h3>Reputation with the Zandalar Tribe us gained from killing trash and bosses in Zul\'Gurub as well as repeatable and special quests which require instance-dropped items to complete. Each full run of Zul\'Gurub gives approximately 2,500-3,000 reputation.<br /><br />Before the Burning Crusade, the main reason for gaining reputation with the tribe were the <a href="?items=0.6&amp;filter=na=Zandalar">shoulder</a>, <a href="?items=0.6&amp;filter=minrl=60;maxrl=60;cr=18:107;crs=4:0;crv=0:to+a+leg+or+head+slot+item">head and leg</a> slot item enchants.

The Goblins believe in profit above loyalty, thus Gadgetzan is considered neutral territory in the Horde/Alliance conflict.<h3>History</h3>Although the goblins\' neutrality is almost universally acknowledged, there are still those who seek to sow chaos and anarchy. For Gadgetzan, this comes in the form of the Wastewander bandits, a gang of miscreants who have occupied the Waterspring Field and Noonshade Ruins of northeast Tanaris. Few goblins care about ancient ruins (unless they have treasure) – for all they care, the bandits can have the old blocks of stone. <br /><br />However, the Waterspring Field is vital to the goblins\' survival in the desert, providing them with the liquid gold of the desert. Water towers out in the field were constructed under the blazing heat of the desert sun by the backbreaking work of their slaves, and by Az, the goblins aren\'t going to give up their hard earned towers that easily. However, the Bruisers need to stay in town to keep the gnomes\' collective Napoleonic-complex from getting out of hand and to stop the seemingly endless dueling among the various visitors from disrupting business.

For those with earthier tastes, the streets along the wharf teem with whorehouses, taprooms, and casinos.<br /><br />Ratchet is the largest port on Kalimdor, with as many ships bringing cargo in as there are ships heading out for other sites around Kalimdor. In addition to legitimate trade vessels, pirate craft receive amnesty while in the port of Ratchet as long as they can pay the stiff docking fees.

The Wildhammer Clan was unsuccessful in wresting control of <a href="?zone=1537">Ironforge</a> from the Bronzebeard and Dark Iron clans.

Thaurissan and his sorceress wife, Modgud, launched a two-pronged assault against both Ironforge and Grim Batol.

Shadows moved at her command, and dark things crawled up from the depths of the earth to stalk the Wildhammers in their own halls. Eventually Modgud broke through the gates and laid siege to the fortress itself. The Wildhammers fought desperately, Khardros himself wading through the roiling masses to slay the sorceress queen. With their queen lost, the Dark Irons fled before the fury of the Wildhammers.<br /><br />Once the immediate Dark Iron threat was eliminated, the Wildhammers returned home to Grim Batol. However, the death of the Modgud had left an evil stain on the mountain fortress, and the Wildhammers found it uninhabitable. Khardros took his people north towards the lands of Lordaeron. Settling within the mountainous region of the Aerie Peaks and The Hinterlands, and lush forests of Northeron, the Wildhammers crafted the city of Aerie Peak, where the Wildhammers grew closer to nature and even bonded with the mighty gryphons of the area.

First, it serves as the base of operations for goblin thorium and arcanite miners since Winterspring has some of the few untapped veins of those materials on the continent. Second, it serves as a center of trade between the Alliance and the Horde. While Everlook is hardly as safe as Moonglade, generally the Alliance and the Horde treat each other fairly well there.

'The <b>Wintersaber Trainers</b> is an Alliance-only faction consisting of only two night elven NPCs that can both be found in <a href="?zone=618">Winterspring</a>. Currently, the only questgiver is <a href="?npc=10618">Rivern Frostwind</a>, who is located at the top of Frostsaber Rock in Winterspring. Upon reaching exalted with this faction, Rivern will sell a special mount, the <a href="?item=13086" class="q4">[Reins of the Winterspring Frostsaber]</a>.<br /><br />This faction\'s mount is the only epic mount (100% riding speed) attainable in the game which only requires 75 riding skill (and thus only costs 90 Gold). The faction is noted for having no Horde counterpart and having the longest and most repetitive reputation grind of the entire game. The first quest can be attained at level 58, while the other two are attainable at level 60.<h3>Reputation</h3>Reputation with the Wintersaber Trainers can only be obtained through three repeatable quests. There are no faction items or mobs that reward repuation directly.<br /><br /><b>Neutral 0 to 1500</b><br />Only one repeatable quest will available at first, so until neutral 1500/3000 is reached the <a href="?quest=4970">Frostsaber Provisions</a> quest should be repeated. Any Shardtooth and Chillvind mob in Winterspring will drop these. This quest should be done solo as the drop rates are low and not shared if others have the quest.<br /><br /><b>Neutral 1500 to Exalted</b><br />Halfway through neutral the <a href="?quest=5201">Winterfall Intrusion</a> quest will be available. This quest requires to kill 10 Winterfall mobs in the Winterfall Village, just east of Everlook. If the quest <a href="?quest=8464">Winterfall Activity</a> has been done with the <a href="?faction=576">Timbermaw Hold</a>, <a href="?item=21383" class="q1">[Winterfall Spirit Beads]</a> can drop from the Winterfall mobs. If a player wants both reputations, saving these until revered with Timbermaw Hold will result in a lot of &quot;free&quot; reputation.<br /><br />This quest can be done in groups for increased speed. Players grinding either Wintersaber Trainers or Timbermaw Hold reputation can often be found in the Winterfall Village. Even with an epic mount, the travel to and from Winterfall Village takes up much time. There are tigers among the route who will daze you, which will result in a demount, this should be avoided (but can be hard as they\'ll catch up with you on a 60% mount). Usually this quest is repeated all the way to exalted, ignoring the third quest. <br /><br /><b>Honored to Exalted</b><br />At honored the third quest <a href="?quest=5981">Rampaging Giants</a> is available. The quest requires the player to kill 8 Frostmaul giants. They are a lot harder than the Winterfall mobs and the travel lengths are quite longer. This quest is usually skipped, and instead Winterfall Intrusion is repeated.<br /><br />Due to some players grinding Timbermaw Hold reputation, in Winterfall Village among other places, this quest can indeed turn out to be a faster reputation reward than the Winterfall Intrusion one.'
